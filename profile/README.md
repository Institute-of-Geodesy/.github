# Institute of Geodesy
The Institute of Geodesy was founded 150 years ago, when the University of Stuttgart was still called Polytechnical School. The reasearch portfolio at GIS over the past several decades covers a broad spectrum of research objectives in satellite geodesy and physical geodesy. The GIS research activities and expertise range from sensor analysis of geodetic satellites through geodetic data analysis methodology to modelling and application of geodetic products in hydrology, geophysics and oceanography.


## Research activities
 - investigation of the system Earth, geodetic aspects of global changes
 - modelling of the gravity field based on satellite gravimetry (GOCE, GRACE)
 - design and simulation of future gravitiy field missions (NGGM)
 - application of satellite gravimetry for hydrological modelling
 - satellite altimetry: gauges of rivers and lakes, river discharge rates

## Public Softwares
The software bundles below are created by the academic staff of the Institute of Geodesy for their current research (hydrogeodesy and satellite gravity missions) and the software is free  available in the sense of the GNU General Public License.
1. SHBundle - TBD
2. Uberall - TBD
3. visBundle - TBD
4. DataDrivenCorrectionBundle - TBD
